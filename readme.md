 
 "Code-war mobile pattern varieties"
 
 For this kata, your job is to implement the function countPatternsFrom(firstPoint, length); where firstPoint is a single-character string corresponding to the point in the grid (i.e.: 'A') and length is an integer indicating the length of the pattern. The function must return the number of combinations starting from the given point, that have the given length.

 Take into account that dots can only be connected with straight directed lines either:

 horizontally (like A to B)
 
 vertically (like D to G),
 
 diagonally (like I and E, as well as B and I), or
 
 passing over a point that has already been 'used' like (G and C passing over E).
